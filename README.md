MISSION 3 BRIEF

If you are in the Advanced Software Developer pathway, complete the following tasks as part of the Mission:

The business (Turners Cars) is interested to add AI capabilities to help its customers. Create a prototype showcasing AI Search capability using IBM Watson Discovery. Relate this to Turners Cars by building a prototype that relates to their business. or explain in your Show and Tell how they can use it.

In your prototype, write a function takes a string as a parameter, and output a string that replaces all punctuations (such as “!”, “?”, “-“, “;”) with a space character. If you can, integrate that to your AI search application to remove all punctuations before using it as a search term.

Build a simple unit test for your trimming functionality. Use these 5 test cases: “hello world”, “hello%world”, “!hello world”, “;hello?world!”, “hello;world” and “hello world?”. You can pick a unit test tool for the programming language you use (This project uses Jest).
